Parts Required

1. 1x Eibos Knob
2. 1x Eibos Latch
3. 1x M3x12mm SHCS
4. 1x M3x5.0Dx4.0L Brass Heatset Insert


Seperating Eibos Door Panels

Use a small Flat Head screwdriver at least 3.0mm wide, any smaller and you'll likley end up marring the panel plastic.
slighlty pry the panels apart at a corner such that you can insert the flat head inbetween the panel elements.
Pry apart slowly until the panels clip detaches.
Work you way around the edges of the panel, until the panels seperate.
Remove the existing pull cord latch and keep the spring, this will be used with the new latch.
(FYI Both panels are identical)

Installing New K3 style Knob

1. Print parts using standard Voron Design settings. Reccomended material is ABS. 
2. Set heat insert into Knob with soldering Iron. A little plastic overflow should not matter.
3. Screw in the M3 SHCS into the latch. The hole should be a tolerance fit to help resist the bolt rotating when installing the knob. Remove the few support extrusions on the latch pin extrusion (See red circled portion in refernce images).
4. Insert the Latch into the latch recess of one of the panels
5. Insert the spring over the pin extrusion feature of the latch, much like the original Eibos latch. 
6. Pry the other end of the spring over the pin extrusion in the panel.
7. Clip the Eibos panels back together taking care to align the slot of one panel over the latch recess with the new printed latch.
8. Screw the knob onto the SHCS screw until it bottoms out, keep turning until the knob clicks into place.
9. The knob will liley still be a little loose/sloppy, to gain a tighter fit, hold the panels and pull on the knob with a small amount of force, rotate the knob 180 degrees until the knob clicks into place once again.
10. You should now have a nicely fitted knob installed on you Eibos door :).
